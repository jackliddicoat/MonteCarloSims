# MonteCarloSims
Some scripts on Monte Carlo simulation. Inlcudes examples in both R and Python, with the Python example being more comprehensive. I have also included a script which makes monte carlo simulation in R one line of code. The result shows a plot of the minimum, median, and maximum series of the simulation.
